# Landing Page Project
# Firstly I built the navigation bar using what we learned previously in the course methods like:
1- document.getElementById()
2-document.querySelectorAll()
3-document.createElement()
4-element.appendChild()
# Second part I researched the element.getBoundingClientRect() method:
I did a deep research on the following method understood it's concept and how it works then with the use of some for loops
and if conditions I built the sectionActivation () we also used the methods (classList.add,classList.remove) taught during the course.
# Finally smooth scrolling:
The function used for smooth scrolling was also deeply researched fully understood and used some basic referencing and mainly the .scrollIntoView() with {behavior : 'smooth'} css code did the trick.
